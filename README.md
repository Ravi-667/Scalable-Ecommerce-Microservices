# Scalable E-Commerce Microservices

This repository contains a full-stack e-commerce platform built with microservices architecture. Tech stack (MVP):
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB (Mongoose)
- Frontend: React (Vite)

This repo is scaffolded with `backend/` and `frontend/` folders. Follow the `Todo.txt` for implementation steps.

Local dev (after services are implemented):
1. Start MongoDB (Docker or local)
2. From `backend/` run `npm install` and `npm run dev`
3. From `frontend/` run `npm install` and `npm run dev`

Suggested commits are listed in `Todo.txt` for each step.
